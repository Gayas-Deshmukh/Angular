**Angular routing**
- Angular routing are used  to navigate from one component to another component. 
- for that we need to have routing file in our project. 
- in that file we can define path and respective component where we want to navigate.
- we can use that path defined in routing file into template file for navigation.
- in template file we can use 'routerLink' attribute to bind with path.
- after navigation where to render data or component? ,for that we need to define one tag called 
  '<router-outlet></router-outlet>' in template where we want to render data.

  **HttpClientModule**
  - we can make the request to server using 'fetch()' method & fetch method gives us promise object,
    from promise we can convert data into json using then() method & use that data. 
  - but angular provoids us one module called 'HttpClientModule' , by using which we can make request to server
    if you use this module then we will get the data from server in the form of 'observabsle'.
    we need to subscribe to the observable for to get the actual data. 
  - observable is part of rxJs library , which is used to perform asynchronous operation.
