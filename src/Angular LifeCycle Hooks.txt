**Angular LifeCycle Hooks**

- in angular component also have lifecycle.
- basically it is a period of component creation till component get distroyed.
- during this period component go throught different phases.
- those phases are represented by different methods/Hooks

those lifecycle hooks are listed below :
1) Constructor()
2) ngOnChanges()
3) ngOnInit()
4) ngDoCheck()
5) ngAfterContentInit()
6) ngAfterContentChecked()
7) ngAfterViewInit()
8) ngAfterViewChecked()
9) ngOnDestroy()

- these methods will get called in between component creation & component distroy.

1) Constructor()
   - it will get called whenever component instance is created.

2) ngOnChanges()
   - this method will get called multiple times.
   - first, this  method will get called when component is get loaded in DOM.
   - it will get also called when @input() decorator propeties get changed or updated.

3) ngOnInit()
   - this method will get called whenever component is get initialized.

4) ngDoCheck()
   - whenever there is some change or update in component then this method get called.
   - this method will get called multiple time.

5) ngOnDestroy()
   - it will get called only one in lifecycle.
   - it will get called before removing component from the DOM.

6) ngAfterContentInit() 
  - generally to establish parent child relationship we can use child component selector into parent component.
  - if we define any content for that child tag then that content will get loaded in child template but
    for that we need to use <ng-content> tag in to child template.
    e.g
     
     <app-child>Some Data</app-child>

     child.component.html
     <ng-content></ng-content>
   
   - this method will get called whenever data present in child selector tag will get loaded into ng-content first time.
   - this method will get called only once in entire lifecycle.

7) ngAfterContentChecked()
  - this method will get called whenever data get updated into <ng-content>
  - this method will get called multiple times.

8) ngAfterViewInit()
  - when parent component get loaded or initialized completely then this method will get called.

9) ngAfterViewChecked()
  - when all child components of current component will get loaded completely then this method will get called.

- all these methods will get called in sequence as listed above.
- all these methods are declared into respective interfaces.
