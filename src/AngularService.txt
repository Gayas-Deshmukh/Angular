**Angular Services**
- Angular services are special class.
- Angualar services are similar to the angular component.
- to create any service using Angular CLI we can use following comd
   ng g s <serviceName>
- it will create only two files 
  1) .ts
  2) .spect.ts
- services are basically used to define some business logic.
- by using services we can share data among different components.
- many components can access same service as per their requirements.(if the component want to execute same business logic).
- services uses special decorator called '@injectible()' decorator.
  - this decorator has one property called 'providedIn'.
  - its value is 'root' which means that any component can access that service.
