** Forms **
- In Angular forms ae used to accept the data from User & submit it to the server.
- in angular forms are classified into two types 

1) Template Driven Forms
  - in this types of form we will write everything in Template.
  - also we can do the validation in template itself.
  - if we don't want to change form in future then we can use this form
 
2) Reactive Form (Model Driven Form)
  - in this type of form we can create UI in Template but we will do validation in controller.
  - mostly this form is being used in industry.
  - in reactive form we can add controls dynamically
  - for that we can make use of FormGroup, FormControl
  - for complex form also we can use this types of form

     we can also use FormBuilder to create Reactive form
     - FormBuilder different methods/services like group,control,array

- Angular provide validation in two ways
  1) Form state validation services
    - it is applicable for form
      a) pristine - if form is Not-Modified then it return TRUE else return FALSE.
      b) dirty    - if form is Modified then it return TRUE else return FALSE.
      c) valid    - if form is valid return TRUE else return FALSE.
      d) invalid  - if form is invalide return TRUE else FALSE.

  2) input state validation services
    - it is applicable for input field
      a) pristine - if field is Not-Modified then it return TRUE else return FALSE.
      b) dirty    - if field is Modified then it return TRUE else return FALSE.
      c) valid    - if field is valid return TRUE else return FALSE.
      d) invalid  - if field is invalide return TRUE else FALSE.
      e) touch    - if field is touched then it will return TRUE else return FALSE
      f) untouched - if field is untouched then it will return TRUE else return FALSE
